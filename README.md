### Undergraduate track submission for the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl

Pre-snap motion and formation shifts are essential to offensive strategy, creating mismatches and confusion for defenses. For savvy defensive coaches and players, recognizing these patterns can give defenses an opportunity to anticipate blocking schemes, exploit opening gaps in the formation tendencies, and make smarter, faster decisions before the ball is even snapped. 
We propose a novel model – TEndencIQ – to answer a simple, but fundamental football question: what is the likelihood that a particular player will block in pass protection?

Drawing from our work as student analysts in college football at Rice University and the University of Georgia and our relevant data science expertise, we’ve observed the significant advantage teams gain when given efficient game-time reports and information. In this project, we aim to modernize and streamline the scouting report process by creating a model that dynamically displays changing blocking assignment probabilities based on pre-snap movements, enabling defenses to anticipate plays before the snap.
